# GeneticMNIST
A demo of deep genetic evolution for the MNIST dataset

The code is probably the fastest MNIST implementation on multicore CPU. This demo however doesn't use multithread. You have to add that yourself.

The code is generated by Cortex Deep Genetic SDK framework. Trained for a simple task like MNIST just to show you the principle.

Have fun and test it. Be critical !!
